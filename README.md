## Introduction

This project is written with Typescript using React. It works only with a front-end, using parsing of command-line arguments and a simple .json file containing all the descriptions of the commands and their flags. It is also easy to self-host since it doesn't contain a server.

## Features

What The Git only contains really basic git commands and flags so far, but the list will grow with time. I expect to support at least git add, git commit and git push. Feel free to contribute to fix issues that you found in the app or to add more git commands to it ! As this is a personal project, I would really appreciate it.

It also features a system that embeds descriptions of git jargon such as staging area, commit etc. as hyperlinks in the command description. You can either hover them to see a short description, or click the "read article" button to be redirected on the full article.

## Upcoming features

- More verbose errors (telling you where the command went wrong and why instead of just showing a generic error message)

Feel free to submit an issue if you have feature requests, I'll gladly take them.

## Supported commands

So far, only a few commands are supported, with a few flags:

- git
  - add
  - commit
  - push
  - rebase
  - diff
  - log
  - pull
  - status

## Contribute

As I stated above, pull requests, bug reports and feature requests are very much appreciated. This is a big project for me, and any help would be truly appreciated! I setup a couple of templates in the issues section if you want to contribute. I don't feel like adding a code of conduct, I only expect contributors to be respectful to each other.

It is advised to read the [developer manual](DEVELOPMENT.md) before intending to contribute on the code. It's here to help you understand the structure of the project!
